<p>teh jigz&nbsp;up is a creative project between&nbsp;Daniel Lynds (<a href="https://twitter.com/daniellynds">@daniellynds</a>) and Kin Lane (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>). We were looking for a way to work together on some storytelling, and this is what we came up with so far. Merging his love of comics, and my mad coding skills, we brainstormed this Google Spreadsheet driven, comic book-esque&nbsp;approach to collaboratively&nbsp;telling stories.</p>
<p>To facilitate our asynchronous conversations I set up a sort of comic jig, with six rows in a Google Spreadsheet driving six frames in each comic strip. Each frame can have a title, description, two text areas, and two images--each with some CSS formatting capabilities. When you change text or images in the spreadsheet it changes what is displayed in the comic strip hosted on Github Pages, as a data-driven Jekyll project.</p>
<p>The idea at the moment centers on one of us&nbsp;kicking off a conversation with a question, topic, or other idea seed. The other person follows up with a response. This continues until all six frames are filled. Then we can add a new sheet, a new page on the website, kicking off an entirely new, or even a continued conversation about each topic. At the moment we have no other constraints on the conversations, beyond what the comic jig imposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an open project being <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/teh-jigz-up/">documented on the project's Jekyll blog</a>, with everything <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml">hosted using Github</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml/issues">Github issues for managing any questions</a>. I do not know where this project is going, we are just playing around and seeing where we can go with things--if nothing else, maybe we will just have developed an interesting new was to tell data-driven stories using Google Spreadsheets and Github.</p>
